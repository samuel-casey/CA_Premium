    <h1>What is this site?</h1>
    <p class="infoP">
        This site helps ocean lovers visualize the real-time water-level, previous tide, and next tide of their favorite beach in the United States. the water-level of the previous tide, and the water-level of the next tide. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>What </h2>

    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p> 
        The tide predictions for this site are sourced from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association's CO-OPS API and utilized in a p5js animation.
        
        The CO-OPS API does not have real-time water-level data for every station that it has tide predictions for, so the inital water-level that loads after the user submits their location is a back-end calculation.

        The back-end is comprised of a Postgresql database and an Express server hosted by Heroku.
